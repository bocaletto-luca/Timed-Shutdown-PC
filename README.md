**Timed Shutdown PC** is a Python application based on tkinter that allows you to schedule the shutdown, restart, or suspension of your computer at a specified time. It's a handy utility for automating computer shutdown actions.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Clock Display:** The app displays a real-time digital clock in the main window.

- **Action Scheduling:** You can specify a time (in HH:MM format) and choose whether to shut down, restart, or suspend the computer at that time.

- **Time Validation:** The app checks if the specified time is in the future and displays an error message if it isn't.

- **Delayed Execution:** The app waits until the specified time and then performs the selected action.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter library (usually included with Python installation)

## How to Use the App

1. Clone or download the repository from GitHub.
2. Run the `main.py` file to launch the app.
3. In the app's interface, enter the desired time and select the action (Shutdown, Restart, Suspend).
4. Click the "Schedule" button to set up the action.
5. The computer will automatically perform the action at the specified time.

## Example

Suppose you want to shut down the computer at 8:30 PM. Follow these steps:

1. Enter "8:30 PM" in the time input.
2. Select "Shutdown" as the action.
3. Click "Schedule."
